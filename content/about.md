# Kunwoo Na

Welcome to my website! I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, interested in mathematics (and applied mathematics).

I am generally interested in describing various phenomena via the language of mathematics, and I am interested in both pure and applied mathematics.

On the mathematics side, I am interested in operator algebras and stochastic analysis. Also, I have a keen interest in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) too! On the application side, I am interested in mathematically designed machine learning algorithms and their theoretical aspects.
